# DirectX: Getting started

This section provides information to help you get started on developing UWP games using DirectX. 

The app object and DirectX topic explains how to use the core user interface framework with DirectX. Since DirectX games run at a lower level in the Windows Runtime stack, they need to interoperate with the user interface framework more fundamentally: by accessing and interoperating with the app object directly.

Project templates and tools for games topic explains how to create a DirectX game project from a template. It introduces editing and diagnostic tools like Model Editor, Shader Designer, and Graphics Frame Analysis which can help you to create, preview, and troubleshoot DirectX graphics.

Launching and resuming apps topic explains how you can define the activation experience of a UWP DirectX game, how to save important system state and app data, and restore important application data 
when your game resumes.
