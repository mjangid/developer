# POS printer device support

Windows supports the ability to print to network and Bluetooth connected receipt printers using the Epson ESC/POS printer control language. For more information on ESC/POS, see [Epson ESC/POS with formatting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/epson-esc-pos-with-formatting).

While the classes, enumerations, and interfaces exposed in the API support receipt printer, slip printer, and journal printer, the driver interface only supports receipt printer. Attempting to use slip printer or journal printer at this time will return a status of not implemented.
