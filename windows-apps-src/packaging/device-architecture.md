# App package architectures

App packages are configured to run on a specific processor architecture. By selecting an architecture, you are specifying which device(s) you want your app to run on. Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps can be configured to run on the following architectures:
- x86
- x64
- ARM

It is highly recommended that you build your app package to target all architectures. By deselecting a device architecture, you are limiting the number of devices your app can run on, which in turn will limit the amount of people who can use your app!

## Windows 10 devices and architectures

| UWP Architecture | Desktop (x86)      | Desktop (x64)      | Desktop (ARM)      | Mobile             | HoloLens           | Xbox               | IoT Core (Device dependent) | 
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| x86              | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark:          |
| x64              | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :x:                | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:          |
| ARM              | :x:                | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :x:                | :x:                | :heavy_check_mark:          |
 

Letâ€™s talk about these architectures in more detail. 

### x86
Choosing x86 is generally the safest configuration for an app package since it will run on nearly every device. On some devices, an app package with the x86 configuation won't run, such as the Xbox or some IoT Core devices.

### x64
This configuration is used less frequently than the x86 configuration. It should be noted that this configuation is reserved for desktops using 64-bit versions of Windows 10, [UWP apps on Xbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/xbox-apps/system-resource-allocation), and Windows 10 IoT Core on the Intel Joule.

### ARM
Windows 10 on ARM, mobile devices, and some IoT Core devices utilize the ARM configuration. There are few devices that can only run on ARM, some of which include Iot Core devices like the Rasperry Pi 2, Raspberry Pi 3, and DragonBoard. Check out this //Build talk to see a demo of [Windows 10 on ARM](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/P4171) and learn more about how it works.
