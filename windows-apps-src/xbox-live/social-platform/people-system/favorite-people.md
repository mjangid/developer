# Favorite People

The Xbox Live People system provides the end user a simple category system for their own People list; rich categorization of people into user-named categories such as "coworkers" and "fps buddies" is not provided because few users would take advantage of it, and supporting it adds complexity to many experiences.

Users can mark anyone on their list as a favorite and those people should show up first and are prioritized higher across features and should show up first in titles anytime a list of people is shown. There is no limit to the number of favorites a user can have.

Users can toggle anyone on their list as a favorite regardless of whether the person is a real-name relationship or Gamertag relationship and has no privacy implications. Also, favorite people are a subset of the user's People list and do not behave like a separate list of people.
