# Xbox Live Social Platform - Profile, Friends, Presence

## In this section

[Xbox Live Social Platform Overview](social-overview.md)  
Discusses the core features and concepts of the Xbox Live Social Platform.  These include Gamertag, Gamerscore, Presence, Clubs and many others.

[Introduction to Social Manager](intro-to-social-manager.md)   
The Social Manager masks the complexity of dealing with multiple Realt Time Activity (RTA) subscriptions, and refreshing data for users and allows developers to easily get the up to date graph they want to create interesting scenarios.

[Xbox Live People System](people-system/xbox-live-people-system.md)   
Xbox Live is migrating from the previous _friends_ system to a new _people_ system that reworks the social fabric in Xbox Live.

[Rich Presence](rich-presence-strings/rich-presence-strings-overview.md)  
By using Rich Presence, your game can advertise what a player is doing right now. For example, your game can use Rich Presence strings to show all gamers the status of your game's players, such as *Away*. Rich Presence information is visible to gamers connected to Xbox Live. Ideally, a Rich Presence string tells other Xbox Live gamers what a player is doing, and where in your game the player is doing it. The concept of Rich Presence strings is the same on Xbox One as it was on Xbox 360, but the new implementation follows the Entertainment as a Service initiative. The topics in this section describe how to configure your Rich Presence strings and then how to set the string for a user playing your title.
