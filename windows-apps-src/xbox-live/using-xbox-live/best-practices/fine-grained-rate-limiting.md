# Xbox Live fine grained rate limiting

## Introduction

This article provides an overview of Xbox Live fine grained rate limiting. In addition to summarizing what rate limiting is this paper also intends to help you determine if you are being limited, and If you are what tools and resources are at your disposal.

## Xbox Live Fine Grained Rate Limiting

**Fine Grained Rate Limiting** was commissioned to promote **fair usage** of shared Xbox Live resources amongst different titles. This solution is like most traditional limiting systems which have a service keeping a count of the number of requests an entity has made in a given period of time.

Entities that reach the services specified limit are then moved to a rejecting state where all incoming requests from the entity will be turned away. Entities are only able to exit this state when the given period of time expires causing the entities associated count to reset.

Fine Grained Rate Limiting uses the same core mechanics mentioned above however instead of tracking one entity FGRL tracks the combination of **user and title** and compares the associated count to **two** different **limits** as oppose to one. FGRL dual limits are enforced on each service meaning the request count for GameClips will not affect the request count for Presence. The following sections will go into more detail about the user and title pairing, dual limiting, and the HTTP 429 limiting response object.

## Fair Usage

Xbox Live believes that each user should have the same high quality experience no matter what game/app he/she is playing. FGRL is designed to solve the following scenario:

Developer A has just released a title that follows all the Xbox live best practices ensuring optimal use of services while Developer B has also just released a title however this one has an unknown bug. This bug causes the title and each user to spam presence which results in the service going under heavy load. The service slows and eventually halts breaking the experience for developer A’s users even though it was developer B’s bug that caused the issue. If FGRL was implemented the service would have been able to stop receiving requests from the miss behaving title allowing it to serve Developer A’s title its fair slice of the resource pie.

## Title and User granularity

Title and User were chosen as the key to ensure fair usage of Xbox Live resources. Tracking just the user would create a scenario in which the user experience would be at the mercy of each titles integration. For example, most titles use the people service already so for the sake of this example, let’s say Fine Grained Rate Limiting was set up on the people service allowing no more than 100 requests in 5 minutes. If a user were to play a game that made 100 requests in 1 minute the limit would be exceeded and the user would not be able to make any more requests to the people service; imagine that in the same period the user then goes back to the home screen and clicks his friends list: Since the user would already have exceeded the limit that friends list call would fail until the 5 minutes interval has passed, even though the home screen was not responsible for putting the user in the limited state.

Alternatively limiting based only on the title would produce an equally unfair result. Setting a limit per title would ignore the popularity of the titles and the requests would just be first come first serve until a limit is reached.

The pairing of User and Title ensures that no title uses more resources than what is appropriate given the number of active users while also giving each user a consistent slice of the resource pie.

The diagram above shows a high level view of how the request is handled. First the request is generated and then received by the desired service. Upon receiving the request, the system checks to see how many times the user and title together have accessed the service. If the request is under the limit, then it will be processed as normal. If the request is found to be at or above the limit the services will drop it and instead return a 429 response. The response will indicate how long until the period rolls over and the user and title requests can be handled.

## Burst and Sustain Limits

Traditionally, rate limiting consists of one limit per endpoint which is tracked over a given period of time. This period represents the amount of time that an entities request count is tracked. At the end of the period the entities count is reset to 0 to begin tracking again.

This approach works for most API’s however it was not resilient enough for games and apps that call Xbox live. The solution above assumes that people are calling in a consistent steady predictable manor. In the Xbox Live case, depending on the service and requesting title/app, the calling patterns are drastically different.

Choosing just one limit in this case would require compromising on both ends of the call pattern spectrum. The Xbox Live solution uses two periods and limits. The smaller period is called the Burst period while the bigger longer one is known as the Sustain period. The burst time period for FGRL is always 15 seconds whereas the sustain is always 300 seconds (5 minutes) So during a 5 minute sustain period there are 20 burst periods. Both burst and sustain limits are tracking at the same time and as such count requests at the same time. Both the burst and the sustain limit are set on the service meaning each service has its own burst and sustain count. To help you understand how these two limits work together the table below shows a user playing a title which is making a number of requests of a service that has implemented FGRL. In this case the burst limit is 30 requests in 15 seconds and the sustain limit is 100 requests over 5 minutes.

| Time Period (seconds)  | Requests per  burst period  | Requests per sustain period  | \# of throttled Requests within the 15 sec interval | Which Limit?                                                                                                                (burst, sustain, or both)  |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0-15        | 35           | 35             | 5                                                   | Burst                     |
| 15-30       | 28           | 63             | 0                                                   | N/A                       |
| 30-45       | 21           | 84             | 0                                                   | N/A                       |
| 45-60       | 36           | 120            | 20                                                  | Both                      |
| 60-75       | 24           | 144            | 24                                                  | Sustain                   |
| …           | …            | …              |                                                     | …                         |
| 285-300     | 4            | 148            |                                                     | Sustain                   |

The table shows that in the first 15 seconds the user trips the burst limit by making 35 requests. Those 5 extra requests are dropped and 5 429 Reponses are sent. It is worth noting that those 5 request though throttled still count towards the sustain limit. Once either limit is tripped no requests are let through as shown when both limits trip at the 45 second mark and again when only 4 requests are made at the 285 second mark.

## HTTP 429 Response object

When the associated user and title count is at or above either the burst or sustain limit the service will not handle the request and will instead return a HTTP 429 response. The HTTP 429 code stands for “too many requests” will be accompanied by a header containing a “retry after X seconds” value. FGRL 429’s contains a retry after header that specifies the amount of time the calling entities should wait before trying again. Developers that use XSAPI will not have to worry as XSAPI honors and handles the Retry-After header. The actual response will contain the following fields:

| Field Name      | Value Type | Example              | Definition                       |
|-----------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Version         | Integer    | ```“version”:1```    |                                  |
| currentRequests | Integer    | ```“currentRequests”:13``` | Total number of requests sent    |
| maxRequests     | Integer    | ```“maxRequests”:10```     | Total number of requests allowed |
| periodInSeconds | Integer    | ```“periodInSeconds”:15`` | Time window                      |
| Type            | String     | ```“type”:”burst”```       | Throttle limit type              |

## Implemented limits

The following services will be implementing FGRL limits which will **begin enforcing in May 2016**. To reiterate, these limits will be the same across all sandboxes and titles. **Any title that is currently in XDP or Dev Center and shipping around May 2016 will be considered Legacy and therefore exempted.** The limits below are not finalized yet

| **Service Name**          | **Burst Limit (15 seconds per user per title)** | **Sustain Limit (300 seconds per user per title)** |

The table above represents the current list of services that were selected for FGRL. This list is not final as new services and existing services can be added. When a service is going to be added the table will be updated and an announcement will be made. The limits represented in the table should also not be viewed as finalized. As services change and evolve so too will the limits however you will be notified and the necessary legacy exemptions will be made.

## How can I determine I am being throttled and what steps can I take?

Please refer to the [Xbox Live Best Practices](best-practices-for-calling-xbox-live.md) document as it will contain steps for improving your call pattern as well as an explanation of how the XSAPI assertion, XSAPI Social and Multiplayer managers, and live trace tool can be used to notify you of and mitigate throttling issues. You can find the best practices paper on GDNP and SDK and XDK docs 1602 and higher

## FAQ

### Can limits change?

The intent is that the published limits will not change over time. However, if the need were to arise, it is possible that some of the limits could be made stricter; in that case, titles already released to RETAIL would be made exempt from the updated limits.

### Are more services going to get limits?

Yes, more services and new services can and will be creating limits. Though just like this first FGRL release you will be notified and the proper precautions will be taken.

### When will these changes take effect?

You will notice limits in dev/cert sandboxes starting in April. In May you can expect to see limits in RETAIL

### What if we can’t adhere to the limits?

Please see the [Xbox Live Best Practices](best-practices-for-calling-xbox-live.md) and ensure you are following these steps.  also consider using the [social manager](../../social-platform/intro-to-social-manager.md) if you are being rate limited with any of the social services.

If after following these steps, you are still unable to remain under the limits, please reach out to your Developer Account Manager.

### What about my existing Title?

Any title in XDP or Dev Center before limits in RETAIL are considered Legacy and exempt

### Content Updates?

For a legacy or exempted title, content updates will also be exempt, though we strongly encourage you to leverage the tools and assets to optimize the service integration aspects of your game.

### Can I get an exemption for my game until I can make a content update?

Please speak with your Developer Account Manager.
