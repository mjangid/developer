# Add Xbox Live support to Unity for XDK with IL2CPP scripting backend for ID@Xbox and managed partners

## Overview

Windows Runtime Support for IL2CPP in Unity

With the release of Unity 5.6f3 the engine has included a new feature that enables developers to use Windows Runtime (WinRT) components directly in script by including them in the game project directly. Until 5.6 developers have needed a plugin, or dll to support any platform feature (including Xbox Live SDK) from game script. This new projection layer removes the plugin requirement, and introduces a new and simplified workflow supported only with games that choose the IL2CPP scripting backend.

For more information on how to get started, see the Unity documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP-WindowsRuntimeSupport.html

## Steps

**1) Install Unity**

Install Unity 5.6 or higher, and ensure you have the Xbox One editor extension installed.

**2) Install Visual Studio Tools for Unity version 3.1 and above for IntelliSense support when using WinMDs**
For Visual Studio 2015, this can be found at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SebastienLebreton.VisualStudio2015ToolsforUnity.  For Visual Studio 2017, the component can be added inside the Visual Studio 2017 installer.

**3) Open a new or existing Unity project**

**4) Switch the platform to Xbox One in the Unity Build Settings menu**

**5) Enable IL2CPP scripting backend in the Unity player settings, and set API compatibility to .NET 4.6**

**6) The Xbox One appropriate system libraries will all be added automatically to your project, and no extra steps are needed to include the platform binaries.**

**7) Add and attach a new C\# script to a Unity object.**

For example, click on a Unity object such as the "Main Camera", and click "Add Component" \| "New Script" \| C\# Script \| and name it "XboxLiveScript". Any game object will do.

**8) Open the script in Visual Studio (with VSTU 3.1+ installed)**

You will notice two projects, open your game script XboxLiveTest.cs in the "Player" project generated by VSTU

This is a special project generated for XDK, and includes references for the winmd files you have placed in your assets.
It will also define the "#if ENABLE_WINMD_SUPPORT" define for you so IntelliSense and syntax highlighting will work properly.

**9) Add the following Xbox Live code to the XboxLiveTest.cs source file**

```cpp

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;

public class XboxLiveTest : MonoBehaviour
{
#if ENABLE_WINMD_SUPPORT
    Windows.Xbox.System.User mCurrentUser = null;
    XboxLiveContext mContext = null;
#endif

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start()
    {
#if ENABLE_WINMD_SUPPORT
        mCurrentUser = Windows.Xbox.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplicationContext.CurrentUser;
        mContext = new XboxLiveContext(mCurrentUser);
#endif
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
    }

    void OnGUI()
    {
        if(mContext != null) Gui.TextArea(new Rect(10,10,50,200), mContext.XboxUserId);
    }
}

```

**10)	Make sure you have 'InternetClient' capability selected in the publishing settings found in player settings**

**11) Build the project in Unity.**

1.  Go to File \| Build Settings, click Xbox One and make sure you click “Switch Platform”

2.  Click "Add Open Scenes" to add the current scene to the build

5.  Click the "Unity C\# Projects" checkbox to generate the Assembly-Csharp.dll projects

6.  Click "Build" for Unity to generate the XDK Visual Studio project that wraps your Unity game in a XDK application. When you get prompted for a location, create a new folder to avoid confusion since a lot of new files will be created. It’s recommended you call the folder "Build", and then select that folder

**13) Compile and run the XDK app from Visual Studio**

This will launch the app like a normal Xbox One ERA title and allow Xbox Live calls to operate.

**14) Rebuild if you make changes to anything in Unity**
  
If you change anything in Unity, then you must rebuild the UWP project.
