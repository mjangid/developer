# Clearing local storage

All data written using the Connected Storage API is saved to the storage volume on development kits. The locally stored data can be deleted using the *xbstorage* tool to perform a factory reset of connected storage.

### To clear local storage

1.  Terminate the app associated with the data you want to clear.
2.  Run the *xbstorage* tool specifying the **reset** command and the **/force** switch.

        xbstorage reset /force

3.  Reboot the console.
