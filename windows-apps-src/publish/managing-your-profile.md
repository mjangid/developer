# Manage account settings and profile info

You can view and update your developer account settings and profile info in the **Account settings** section of the [Windows Dev Center dashboard](using-the-windows-dev-center-dashboard.md). 

## Account settings

To access **Account settings**, select the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of your dashboard. Here's you'll find details about your account, and links to other pages where you can view and/or update info and perform various other tasks.

In the **Account details** section, you can see the status and type of your account. You can also find your publisher ID info on this page, including your Seller ID, Windows publisher ID, and Windows Phone publisher ID. These values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account. You cannot edit these values.

> [!NOTE]
> Identity details for your individual apps can be found in the [App identity](view-app-identity-details.md) page for each app.

## Contact info

The **Contact info** section displays the info you provided when setting up your account. We use this info to contact you about your account.

You can edit this section if any of your contact info has changed. To do so, click **Update** (or select **Contact info** in the left navigation menu), make your changes, and then click **Save**.

Note that changing any of your contact info may require us to verify your account again, especially if you have a company account. Your verification status will return to **Pending** while this is in process. The verification process can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company from our verification partner Dun & Bradstreet (so make sure your contact information is up to date).

If you change your publisher display name, we’ll need to verify your account again. If you do this after you have published an app, you'll need to modify the publisher display name in your app's packages and submit the app again using the updated packages after your account has been reverified.
