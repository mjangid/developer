# Understand IRS tax forms issued by Microsoft

Depending on your location and the amount of sales and/or payments you receive, you may receive one or more tax forms from Microsoft each year. Microsoft is required to issue these forms and file them with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Below, we'll explain more about these forms, including who will receive them and when they are made available.

## Types of tax forms

| IRS tax form | Description | Availability |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
|1099-MISC, 1099-K | Related to sales activity and/or payments made to you for participation in Microsoft's marketplaces | Printed forms will be postmarked on or before **January 31**, and .pdf copies will be available in Dev Center (**Dashboard > Account settings > Tax profile**) at the same time |
|1042-S | Related to payments made to you that are subject to United States withholding tax. | Printed forms will be postmarked on or before **March 15**, and .pdf copies will be available in Dev Center (**Dashboard > Account settings > Tax profile**) at the same time |

> [!NOTE]
> The address listed on IRS tax forms comes from the address in your [Tax profile](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md#tax-forms). If your address has changed, please make sure to update the address in your **Tax profile**.

## For developers located outside of the United States

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**I received a form 1042-S from Microsoft. What is it for?**</td>
    <td valign="top">Microsoft has provided you with a 1042-S form or forms because we paid you revenue that is considered reportable to the United States tax authorities and was subject to withholding tax.  Form 1042-S is used for this reporting requirement.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**What should I do with the forms?**</td>
    <td valign="top">Generally, no specific action is required on your part. The form 1042-S may be useful to you if you want to apply to your local tax authorities for any form of tax credit.  You should consult with your own tax advisors to get more information on this topic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**Why was tax withheld on my payments when I completed a W8 form?**</td>
    <td valign="top">Taxes will be withheld if either:<br>
     1. You did not complete the tax treaty section of the W8 correctly, or<br>
     2. You are resident in a country that does not have a tax treaty with the United States.

     You can visit Dev Center at any time to submit an updated W8 form.<br>
     <br>
     **Note:** Not all income is subject to tax withholding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**I submitted an updated W8 form with valid treaty information. Can Microsoft refund me the tax that was withheld?**</td>
    <td valign="top">Once tax has been withheld, it cannot be refunded. You should discuss with your tax advisers whether you can claim a local credit for these taxes, or whether you can seek a refund from the IRS.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**What sales are reported on form 1042-S?**</td>
    <td valign="top">Only sales made **to buyers located in the United States that were classified as subject to tax withholding** are reportable.  All other sales are not considered reportable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">**Why did I get 3 copies of the same form 1042-S in one envelope?**</td>
    <td valign="top">IRS regulations require three copies of the form to be provided:
<ul>
<li>One for the recipient's records</li>
<li>One for filing with a United States Federal tax return (if applicable)</li>
<li>One for filing with a United States State tax return (if applicable)</li>
</ul></td>
