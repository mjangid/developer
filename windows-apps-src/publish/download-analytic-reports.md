# Download analytics reports


You can download files that contain your analytic data so that you can review your stats and info offline.

When viewing your analytic reports, you'll see an arrow icon within each section for which you can download data. Click the arrow to generate a downloadable .tsv file, which you can open in Microsoft Excel or another program that supports tab-separated values (TSV) files.

You can also download reports for all of your apps, or for a specific app, by expanding **Analyze** in the left navigation menu and selecting **Download reports**. In the **Select an app** drop-down list, choose **All apps** or a specific app. Select the report you want to download, then choose your desired aggregation level and date range. Click the **Download reports** button to generate a downloadable .tsv file, which you can open in Microsoft Excel or another program that supports tab-separated values (TSV) files.
