# Set roles or custom permissions for account users

When you [add users to your Dev Center account](add-users-groups-and-azure-ad-applications.md), you'll need to specify what access they have within the account. You can do this by assigning them [standard roles](#roles) which applies to the entire account, or you can [customize their permissions](#custom) to provide the appropriate level of access. Some of the custom permissions apply to the entire account, and some can be limited to one or more specific products (or granted to all products, if you prefer).

> [!NOTE] 
> The same roles and permissions can be applied regardless of whether you are adding a user, a group, or an Azure AD application.

When determining what role or permissions to apply, keep in mind: 
-   Users (including groups and Azure AD applications) will be able to access the entire Dev Center account with the permissions associated with their assigned role, unless you [customize permissions](#custom) and assign [product-level permissions](#product-level-permissions) so that they can only work with specific apps and/or add-ons.
-   You can allow a user, group, or Azure AD application to have access to more than one role's functionality by selecting multiple roles, or by using custom permissions to grant the access you'd like.
-   A user with a certain role (or set of custom permissions) may also be part of a group that has a different role (or set of permissions). In that case, the user will have access to all of the functionality associated with both the group and the individual account.

## Assign roles to account users

By default, a set of standard roles is presented for you to choose from when you add a user, group, or Azure AD application to your Dev Center account. Each role has a specific set of permissions in order to perform certain functions within the account. 

Unless you opt to define [custom permissions](#custom) by selecting **Customize permissions**, each user, group, or Azure AD application that you add to an account must be assigned at least one of the following standard roles. 

> [!NOTE]
> The **owner** of the account is the person who first created it with a Microsoft account (and not any user(s) added through Azure AD). This account owner is the only person with complete access to the account, including the ability to delete apps, create and edit all account users, and change all financial and account settings. 


| Role                 | Description              |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Manager              | Has complete access to the account, except for changing tax and payout settings. This includes managing users in Dev Center, but note that the ability to create and delete users is dependent on the account's permission in Azure AD. That is, if a user is assigned the Manager role, but does not have administrator permissions in the organization's Azure AD, they will not be able to create new users or delete users from the directory (though they can change a user's Dev Center role). |
| Developer            | Can upload packages and submit apps and add-ons, and can view the [Usage report](usage-report.md) for telemetry details. Can’t view financial info or account settings.   |
| Business Contributor | Can view [Health](health-report.md) and [Usage](usage-report.md) reports. Can't create or submit products, change account settings, or view financial info.                                         |
| Finance Contributor  | Can view [payout reports](payout-summary.md), financial info, and acquisition reports. Can’t make any changes to apps, add-ons, or account settings.                                                                                                                                   |
| Marketer             | Can [respond to customer reviews](respond-to-customer-reviews.md) and view non-financial [analytic reports](analytics.md). Can’t make any changes to apps, add-ons, or account settings.      |

The table below shows some of the specific features available to each of these roles (and to the account owner).

|                                 |    Account owner                 |    Manager                       |    Developer                     |    Business Contributor    |    Finance Contributor    |    Marketer                      |

|    Tax profile                  |    Can update                    |    No access                     |    No access                     |    No access               |    Can view               |    No access                     |

If none of the standard roles are appropriate, or you wish to limit access to specific apps and/or add-ons, you can grant custom permissions to the user by selecting **Customize permissions**, as described below.


<span id="custom" />
## Assign custom permissions to account users

To assign custom permissions rather than standard roles, click **Customize permissions** in the **Roles** section when adding or editing the user account. 

To enable a permission for the user, toggle the box to the appropriate setting. 

![Guide to access settings](images/permission_key.png)

- **No access**: The user will not have the indicated permission.
- **Read only**: The user will have access to view features related to the indicated area, but will not be able to make changes. 
- **Read/write**: The user will have access to make changes associated with the area, as well as viewing it.
- **Mixed**: You can’t select this option directly, but the **Mixed** indicator will show if you have allowed a combination of access for that permission. For example, if you grant **Read only** access to **Pricing and availability** for **All products**, but then grant **Read/write** access to **Pricing and availability** for one specific product, the **Pricing and availability** indicator for **All products** will show as Mixed. The same applies if some products have **No access** for a permission, but others have **Read/write** and/or **Read only** access.

For some permissions, such as those related to viewing analytic data, only **Read only** access can be granted. Note that in the current implementation, some permissions have no distinction between **Read only** and **Read/write** access. Please review the details for each permission to understand the specific capabilities granted by **Read only** and/or **Read/write** access.

The specific details about each permission are described in the tables below.

## Account-level permissions

The permissions in this section cannot be limited to specific products. Granting access to these permissions allows the user to have that permission for the entire account.

\* Permissions marked with an asterisk (*) grant access to features which are not available to all accounts. If your account has not been enabled for these features, your selections for these permissions will not have any effect.   


## Product-level permissions

The permissions in this section can be granted to all products in the account, or can be customized to allow the permission only for one or more specific products. 

Product-level permissions are grouped into four categories: **Analytics**, **Monetization**, **Publishing**, and **Xbox Live**. You can expand each of these categories to view the individual permissions in each category. You also have the option to enable **All permissions** for one or more specific products.

To grant a permission for every product in the account, make your selections for that permission (by toggling the box to indicate **Read only** or **Read/write**) in the row marked **All products**. 
 
> [!TIP]
> Selections made for **All products** will apply to every product currently in the account, as well as any future products created in the account. To prevent permissions from applying to future products, select all of the products individually rather than choosing **All products**.

Below the **All products** row, you’ll see each product in the account listed on a separate row. To grant a permission for only a specific product, make your selections for that permission in the row for that product.

Each add-on is listed in a separate row underneath its parent product, along with an **All add-ons** row. Selections made for **All add-ons** will apply to all current add-ons for that product, as well as any future add-ons created for that product.

Note that some permissions cannot be set for add-ons. This is either because they don’t apply to add-ons (for example, the **Customer feedback** permission) or because the permission granted at the parent product level applies to all add-ons for that product (for example, **Promotional codes**). Note, however, that any permission that is available for add-ons must be set separately; add-ons do not inherit selections made for the parent product. For example, if you wish to allow a user to make pricing and availability selections for an add-on, you would need to enable the **Pricing and availability** permission for the add-on (or for **All add-ons**), whether or not you have granted the **Pricing and availability** permission for the parent product.
