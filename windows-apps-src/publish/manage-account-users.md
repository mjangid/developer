# Manage account users

You can use Azure Active Directory to add and manage additional users in your Dev Center account. You can define the role or custom permissions that each user should have. You can also assign a role to a group of users, or to an Azure AD application.

In order to add and manage account users, you must first associate your Dev Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory. 

To manage account users, go to **Account settings** and select **Manage users**.

This section describes how to do the following:
