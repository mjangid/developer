# Submit an app with ads to the Store


After you finish developing your app with ads, you can publish your app to the Windows Dev Center dashboard so it is available in the Windows Store. For more information about this process, see [App submissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/app-submissions).

All apps submitted to the Windows Store must follow the [Windows Store Policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn764944.aspx) and terms specified in the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx). Apps that use the Microsoft advertising libraries must meet the additional requirements that are specified in Exhibit E of the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058.aspx).
