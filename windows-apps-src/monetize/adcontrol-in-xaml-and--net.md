# AdControl in XAML and .NET


This walkthrough shows how to use the [AdControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.aspx) class to display banner ads in a XAML app for Windows 10 (UWP), Windows 8.1, or Windows Phone 8.1.

For a complete sample project that demonstrates how to add banner ads to a XAML app using C# and C++, see the [advertising samples on GitHub](http://aka.ms/githubads).

## Prerequisites

* For UWP apps: install the [Microsoft Advertising SDK](http://aka.ms/ads-sdk-uwp) with Visual Studio 2015 or a later release.
* For Windows 8.1 or Windows Phone 8.1 apps: install the [Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows and Windows Phone 8.x](http://aka.ms/store-8-sdk) with Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2013.

## Code development

1. In Visual Studio, open your project or create a new project.

2. If your project targets **Any CPU**, update your project to use an architecture-specific build output (for example, **x86**). If your project targets **Any CPU**, you will not be able to successfully add a reference to the Microsoft advertising library in the following steps. For more information, see [Reference errors caused by targeting Any CPU in your project](known-issues-for-the-advertising-libraries.md#reference_errors).

1.  From the **Solution Explorer** window, right click **References**, and select **Add Referenceâ€¦**

2.  In **Reference Manager**, select one of the following references depending on your project type:

    -   For a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) project: Expand **Universal Windows**, click **Extensions**, and then select the check box next to **Microsoft Advertising SDK for XAML** (Version 10.0).

    -   For a Windows 8.1 project: Expand **Windows 8.1**, click **Extensions**, and then select the check box next to **Ad Mediator SDK for Windows 8.1 XAML**. This option will add both the Microsoft advertising and ad mediator libraries to your project, but you can ignore the ad mediator libraries.

    -   For a Windows Phone 8.1 project: Expand **Windows Phone 8.1**, click **Extensions**, and then select the check box next to **Ad Mediator SDK for Windows Phone 8.1 XAML**. This option will add both the Microsoft advertising and ad mediator libraries to your project, but you can ignore the ad mediator libraries.

3.  In **Reference Manager**, click OK.

4.  Modify the XAML for the page where you are embedding advertising to include the **Microsoft.Advertising.WinRT.UI** namespace. For example, in the default sample app generated by Visual Studio (named, in this app, MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML), the XAML page is **MainPage.XAML**.

    The **Page** section of the MainPage.xaml file generated by Visual Studio has the following code.

    ``` xml
    <Page
      x:Class="MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML.MainPage"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns:local="using:MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML"
      xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
      xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
      mc:Ignorable="d">
      <Grid Background="{ThemeResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}">
      </Grid>
    </Page>
    ```

    Add the namespace reference **Microsoft.Advertising.WinRT.UI** so the **Page** section of the MainPage.xaml file has the following code.

    ``` xml
    <Page
      x:Class="MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML.MainPage"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns:local="using:MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML"
      xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
      xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
      xmlns:UI="using:Microsoft.Advertising.WinRT.UI"
      mc:Ignorable="d">
      <Grid Background="{ThemeResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}">
      </Grid>
    </Page>
    ```

5. In the **Grid** tag, add the code for the **AdControl**. Assign the  [AdUnitId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.adunitid.aspx) and [ApplicationId](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.applicationid.aspx) properties in the **Page** to the test values provided in [Test mode values](test-mode-values.md). Also adjust the height and width of the control so it is one of the [supported ad sizes for banner ads](supported-ad-sizes-for-banner-ads.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Every **AdControl** has a corresponding *ad unit* that is used by our services to serve ads to the control, and every ad unit consists of an *ad unit ID* and *application ID*. In these steps, you assign test ad unit ID and application ID values to your control. These test values can only be used in a test version of your app. Before you publish your app to the Store, you must [replace these test values with live values](#release) from Windows Dev Center.

    The complete **Grid** tag looks like this code.

    ``` xml
    <Grid Background="{StaticResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}">
        <UI:AdControl ApplicationId="3f83fe91-d6be-434d-a0ae-7351c5a997f1"
            AdUnitId="test"
            HorizontalAlignment="Left"
            Height="250"
            VerticalAlignment="Top"
            Width="300"/>
    </Grid>
    ```

    The complete code for the MainPage.xaml file should look like this.

    ``` xml
    <Page
      x:Class="MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML.MainPage"
      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
      xmlns:local="using:MyAdFundedWindows10AppXAML"
      xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
      xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
      xmlns:UI="using:Microsoft.Advertising.WinRT.UI"
      mc:Ignorable="d">
      <Grid Background="{StaticResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}">
            <UI:AdControl ApplicationId="3f83fe91-d6be-434d-a0ae-7351c5a997f1"
                  AdUnitId="test"
                  HorizontalAlignment="Left"
                  Height="250"
                  VerticalAlignment="Top"
                  Width="300"/>
      </Grid>
    </Page>
    ```

6.  Compile and run the app to see it with an ad.

<span id="release" />
## Release your app with live ads using Windows Dev Center

1.  In the Dev Center dashboard, go to the [Monetize with ads](../publish/monetize-with-ads.md) page for your app and [create an ad unit](../monetize/set-up-ad-units-in-your-app.md). For the ad unit type, specify **Banner**. Make note of both the ad unit ID and the application ID.

2. If your app is a UWP app for Windows 10, you can optionally enable ad mediation for the **AdControl** by configuring the settings in the [Ad mediation](../publish/monetize-with-ads.md#mediation) section on the [Monetize with ads](../publish/monetize-with-ads.md) page. Ad mediation enables you to maximize your ad revenue and app promotion capabilities by displaying ads from multiple ad networks, including ads from other paid ad networks such as Taboola and Smaato and ads for Microsoft app promotion campaigns.

3.  In your code, replace the test ad unit values (**ApplicationId** and **AdUnitId**) with the live values you generated in Dev Center.

4.  [Submit your app](../publish/app-submissions.md) to the Store using the Dev Center dashboard.

5.  Review your [advertising performance reports](../publish/advertising-performance-report.md) in the Dev Center dashboard.

<span id="manage" />
## Manage ad units for multiple ad controls in your app

You can use multiple **AdControl** objects in a single app (for example, each page in your app might host a different **AdControl** object). In this scenario, we recommend that you assign a different ad unit to each control. Using different ad units for each control enables you to separately [configure the mediation settings](../publish/monetize-with-ads.md#mediation) and get discrete [reporting data](../publish/advertising-performance-report.md) for each control. This also enables our services to better optimize the ads we serve to your app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use each ad unit in only one app. If you use an ad unit in more than one app, ads will not be served for that ad unit.

## Notes

* C#: See [XAML properties example](xaml-properties-example.md) for an example of how to assign event handlers to **AdControl** events. Then see [AdControl events in C#](adcontrol-events-in-c.md) for sample code that shows event handlers written in C#.

* C++: The current release of the Microsoft advertising libraries support C++. The **AdControl** class is implemented in native C++, and does not load the .NET CLR. For code examples that demonstrate how to use **AdControl** in C++, see the [advertising samples on GitHub](http://aka.ms/githubads).

* Visual Basic: See [XAML properties example](xaml-properties-example.md) for an example of how to assign event handlers to **AdControl** events.

* Error Handling: To learn about how to handle errors, see [AdControl error handling](adcontrol-error-handling.md).
