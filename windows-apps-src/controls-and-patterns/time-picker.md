# Time picker

The time picker gives you a standardized way to let users pick a time value using touch, mouse, or keyboard input. 

> **Important APIs**: [TimePicker class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.timepicker.aspx), [Time property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.timepicker.time.aspx)


## Is this the right control?
Use a time picker to let a user pick a single time value.

For more info about choosing the right control, see the [Date and time controls](date-and-time.md) article.

## Examples

The entry point displays the chosen time, and when the user selects the entry point, a picker surface expands vertically from the middle for the user to make a selection. The time picker overlays other UI; it doesn't push other UI out of the way.

## Create a time picker

This example shows how to create a simple time picker with a header.

```xaml
<TimePicker x:Name=arrivalTimePicker Header="Arrival time"/>
```

```csharp
TimePicker arrivalTimePicker = new TimePicker();
arrivalTimePicker.Header = "Arrival time";
```

The resulting time picker looks like this:
