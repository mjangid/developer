The new XAML TreeView control enables a hierarchical list with expanding and collapsing nodes that contain nested items. It can be used to illustrate a folder structure or nested relationships in your UI.

> **Important APIs**: [TreeView class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeview), [TreeViewItem class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeviewitem), [TreeViewList class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeviewlist), [TreeViewNode class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeviewnode)

The TreeView APIs support the following features:

- N-level nesting
- Expanding/collapsing of nodes
- Built-in accessibility

## Is this the right control?

- Use a TreeView when items have nested list items, and if it is important to illustrate the hierarchical relationship of items to their peers and nodes.

- Avoid using TreeView if highlighting the nested relationship of an item is not a priority. For most drill-in scenarios, a regular list view is appropriate

## TreeView UI structure

You can use icons to represent nodes in a TreeView. A combination of indentation and icons can be used to represent the nested relationship between
folder/parent nodes and non-folder/child nodes. Here is guidance on how to do so.

### Icons

Use icons to indicate that an item is a node, as well as what state the node is in (expanded or collapsed).

#### Chevron

For consistency, collapsed nodes should use a chevron pointing to the right, and expanded nodes should use a chevron pointing down.

#### Folder

Use a folder icon only for literal representations of folders.

#### Chevron and Folder

A combination of a chevron and a folder should be used only if non-node list items in the TreeView also have icons.

## Building a TreeView

TreeView has the following main classes.

- The [TreeViewNode](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeviewnode) class implements the hierarchical layout for the TreeView. It also holds the data that will be bound to it in the item's template.
- The [TreeView](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeview) class implements events for ItemClick and expand/collapse of folders.
- The [TreeViewItem](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.treeviewitem) class has the styles, brushes, and glyphs for a folder type TreeViewItem.

## Declare a TreeView in XAML

Here's an example of a TreeView declared in XAML.

```xaml
<TreeView x:Name="sampleTreeView"/>
```

## Set up the data in your TreeView

Here is the code that sets up the data for the TreeView.

```csharp
public MainPage()
{
    this.InitializeComponent();

    TreeViewNode workFolder = new TreeViewNode() {Data = "Work Documents" };
    workFolder.IsExpanded = true;
    workFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Feature Schedule" });
    workFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Overall Project Plan" });
    workFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Feature Rsource Allocation" });

    TreeViewNode remodelFolder = new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Home Remodel" };
    remodelFolder.IsExpanded = true;
    remodelFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Contractor Contact Info" });
    remodelFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Paint Color Scheme" });
    remodelFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Flooring woodgrain type" });
    remodelFolder.Add(new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Kitchen cabinet style" });

    TreeViewNode personalFolder = new TreeViewNode() { Data = "Personal Documents" };
    personalFolder.IsExpanded = true;

    personalFolder.Add(remodelFolder);
    workFolder.Add(personalFolder);
    sampleTreeView.RootNode = workFolder;
}
```

Once you’re done with the above steps, you will have a fully populated TreeView/Hierarchical layout with n-level nesting, support for expand/collapse of folders, and accessibility built in.

To provide the user the ability to add/remove items from the TreeView, we recommend you add a context menu to expose those options to the user.
