# Data access

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

This section discusses storing data on the device in a private database and using object relational mapping in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.

SQLite is included in the UWP SDK. Entity Framework Core works with SQLite in UWP apps. Use these technologies to develop for offline / intermittent connectivity scenarios, and to persist data across app sessions.

| Topic | Description|
|-------|------------|
| [Entity framework Core with SQLite for C# apps](entity-framework-7-with-sqlite-for-csharp-apps.md) | Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables you to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. This article explains how you can use Entity Framework Core with a SQLite database in a Universal Windows app. |
| [SQLite databases](sqlite-databases.md) | SQLite is a server-less, embedded database engine. This article explains how to use the SQLite library included in the SDK, package your own SQLite library in a Universal Windows app, or build it from the source. |
