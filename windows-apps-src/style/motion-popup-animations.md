Pop-up elements are containers that appear over the app's content and are dismissed if the user taps or clicks outside of the pop-up element.<div class="important-apis" ><b>Important APIs</b><br/><ul><li>[**PopInThemeAnimation class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210383)</li><li>[**PopupThemeTransition class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh969172)</li></ul></div>## Do's and don'ts-   Use pop-up animations to show or hide custom pop-up UI elements that aren't a part of the app page itself. The common controls provided by Windows already have these animations built in.-   Don't use pop-up animations for tooltips or dialogs.-   Don't use pop-up animations to show or hide UI within the main content of your app; only use pop-up animations to show or hide a pop-up container that displays on top of the main app content.## Related articles* [Animations overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187350)* [Animating pop-up UI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/jj649433)* [Quickstart: Animating your UI using library animations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh452703)* [**PopInThemeAnimation class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210383)* [**PopOutThemeAnimation class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210391)* [**PopupThemeTransition class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh969172)
