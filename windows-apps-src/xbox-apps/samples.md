# UWP on Xbox One samples

TVHelpers is a set of JavaScript and XAML/C# samples and libraries to help you build great Xbox One and TV experiences in JavaScript and C#. TVJS is a library that helps you build premium Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps for Xbox One. 

TVJS includes support for automatic controller navigation, rich media playback, search, and more. You can use TVJS with your hosted web app just as easily as with a packaged web UWP app with full access to the Windows Runtime APIs.
  
For more information, see the [TVHelpers](https://github.com/Microsoft/TVHelpers) project and the project [wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/TVHelpers/wiki).
