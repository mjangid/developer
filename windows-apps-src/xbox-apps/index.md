# UWP on Xbox One

Get started building apps for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) on Xbox One.

UWP on Xbox One supports developing both apps and games. You don't have to be part of a developer program to experiment, create, and test games or apps on Xbox. All you need is a [developer account](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/store/register) on Windows Dev Center. When you are ready to publish and sell games on Xbox One or take advantage of Xbox Live on Windows 10, you need to join the [Xbox Live Creators Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/games/xbox/xboxlive/creator) or be an [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/Developers/id) developer. If you plan to be an [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/Developers/id) developer, we recommend applying to the program first before registering for a developer account. For more info, see [Developer Program Overview](../xbox-live/developer-program-overview.md).

This section includes setup steps, a guide through the authentication process, information about installing the required versions of Visual Studio and Windows 10 tools, and the steps to build, run, and debug your first simple application.
