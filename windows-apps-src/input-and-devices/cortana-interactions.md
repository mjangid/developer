# Cortana interactions in UWP apps

Cortana offers a robust and comprehensive extensibility framework that enables you to seamlessly incorporate functionality from your app or service into the Cortana experience.

## We've moved

All developer documentation for Cortana features and services is now available through the [Cortana dev center](https://developer.microsoft.com/cortana).

To get started, see the [Overview of Cortana extensibility](https://msdn.microsoft.com/cortana/getstarted).

To learn how to extend Cortana with functionality from a UWP app using voice commands, see [Cortana voice commands](https://developer.microsoft.com/cortana).
