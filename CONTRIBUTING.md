# Contributing to UWP Conceptual Documentation

Thank you for your interest in the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) documentation! We appreciate your feedback, edits, and additions to our docs.

This page covers the basic steps for contributing to our developer documentation.

## Public and private repos

The UWP conceptual docs are hosted in two different repos which are then merged and updated to a single site: one repo is for contributions from anyone and the other is only for Microsoft employees.

If you are ***not*** a Microsoft employee, work in the [public content repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp).

If you ***are*** a Microsoft employee, you can work in either the public repo or the [private content repository](https://cpubwin.visualstudio.com/_git/windows-uwp). Employees can push changes live slightly more quickly by contributing in the private repo, or use a [specific branch](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-authoring-guide/uwp/conceptual/setup-local-repo-for-large-changes#what-branch-should-i-use-for-my-authoring) for changes that need to stay under wraps until some future date.

## Editing topics on the public repo

We've tried to make editing an existing file as simple as possible. 
- If you're already in the repo, just navigate to the file and click the **Edit** button.  
- Alternatively, if you're viewing a Docs.microsoft.com page in your browser, click the **Edit** button on the top right of the page. You will be redirected to the correct Markdown source file in the repo, where you can click the **Edit** button. 

GitHub automatically forks the official repo into your personal GitHub account, where you can make your changes. When you're done, submit a pull request back to the "docs" branch. After you create the pull request, a member of the UWP Documentation team will review your changes. 
If your request is accepted, updates are published to https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/.

You can learn the basics of Markdown in just a few minutes.  To get started, check out [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Making more substantial changes

To make substantial changes to an existing article, add or change images, or contribute a new article, you will need to create a local clone of our private content repo. Follow the [instructions in our Windows Authoring Guide](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-authoring-guide/uwp/conceptual/). If you have not yet set up a GitHub account and domain-joined your Microsoft alias, [start here](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-authoring-guide/github-account).

## Using issues to provide feedback on UWP Conceptual documentation

If you just want to provide feedback rather than directly modifying actual documentation pages, you can [create an issue in the public repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp/issues). Click the "Issues" tab and then click the **New issue** button. Be sure to include the topic title and the URL for the page.

Members of the UWP documentation team review issues regularly and will triage, assign, and address them accordingly.
